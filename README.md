# weizPVP-Dragonflight- v2.0.0.1 (Patched for Dragonflight + The War Within)

This killer addon was created by the great weiz!
I hope you are recovering after your accident! I know we are all sending
you get well wishes and prayers from Mesostealthy & friends!

So for now, I'm just going through this addon and fixing the stuff that
Blizzard changed in the Dragonflight v10.0.0 prepatch! I can't say that
I know exactly how everything works in weizPVP because it's such a HUGE
addon! But I'll do my best to get most things at least working like they
did in the Shadowlands!

You may know me as Mesostealthy from the Alterac Valley Maniacs!
SO you know I have to have this addon working going forward.
I just hope I can do it justice even partially as much as
weiz did for it! Such an amazing addon, couldn't let it die!
